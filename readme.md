due to the board that I design haven't been manufactured and built, so this project mainly has two branchs. 

## rProgram
this branch include the program that use on the board that have been built. 

## report-writting
this branch is for me writting the report, it has the schematic and PCB layout that I make.

---
other branchs are "history's legacy"
